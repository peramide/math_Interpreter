# math_Interpreter
A simple Python program that acts as a mini math interpreter. It prompts the user for an arithmetic expression in the form x y z (e.g., 3 * 4) and outputs the result as a floating-point number rounded to one decimal place.

Handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with error checking for invalid input and division by zero. Includes pytest tests in test_interpreter.py to verify correct calculations and ensure the interpreter runs reliably.
